When she finally realized that the victory of her kingdom was only made possible by the sacrifices of her people, she swore to never hide from her duties.

7,Bernheim,"Born in a noble family in Penteonia, Bernheim von Lachelima was gifted with outstanding martial skills. He had the strength of a giant and excellent judgment, so it was undeniable that he would make a great knight. However, he had a fatal flaw that kept him from being successful in Penteonia: He could not use the power of light at all. No matter how hard he tried, how strong his faith and will were, the power of light did not answer to his calling. Although all he ever wanted was to serve his nation and the Queen, the fact that his incapability was keeping him from being more than a low-level knight frustrated him. Bernheim did not give up and trained hard to handle the power of light, but his constant lack of progress slowly started to weaken his mind. One day, he visited the Central Church to study the power of light and its mechanism. It was when he was quietly reading a book that he heard a sound. It was an angelic voice calling for him. The long-accumulated frustration of Bernheim led him to where the voice was coming from, a room sealed with multiple magic barriers in the basement of the church. As he moved closer to it, the barriers vanished as if they were never there. What he saw inside the room was a sword in the shape of an angel, exuding blinding light. 'You are the chosen one', said the sword, drawing him near with holy light. Thinking that his relentless effort had finally paid off, he slowly grasped the sword. Then, his mind was drawn into the deepest darkness. The darkness that captured himâ€”it was the endless shadowy void of futility. A vessel that could never be filled; a whole other universe. In the vast darkness, Bernheim felt his mind deteriorating and his existence fading away. His mind and body was slowly being encroached by a dark, ominous power. However, Bernheim was also one of the Penteonian Knights, a Knight of Light who swore not to be defeated by darkness. He rose from the shrouding darkness, regaining consciousness with his indomitable spirit. When he came to his senses, lying on the floor, there was a giant black sword in his hand. The demonic sword with the appearance of a demon was laughing and mocking the knight who broke away from the path of light. Eventually, Bernheim was banished from Penteonia, and he started to live a new life as a mercenary in Vespia Empire with that malicious, foul-mouthed demonic sword in his hand...",2020-06-07 13:44:21.707812,2020-06-16 09:08:43.941497,bernheim,Magic,2,Front

79,Yuria,"If one asks who the most famous tailor is in Orbis Continent, most people won't know who to name. However, those who know a thing or two about clothing will never fail to bring up Yuria's name. Yuria, a tailor from Penteonia, always has two conditions that she sets when accepting requests. First, the client needs to allow Yuria to spend some time with the client so that she draws inspiration as to what kind of clothing she would make. Second, while she is with the client, the client must not lie or pretend to be something they are not. The first condition is for her sense of 'Foresight.' She needs to feel the client's thread of fate so she can express it through clothing. The second condition is mainly because she can sense the truth and finds lies disgusting. She doesn't want to make anything for anyone who won't be true. Her masterpieces, made with the fate she's read, are as valuable as starlight. Even the nobles would be envious of them.",2020-06-07 14:56:35.260732,2020-06-16 09:29:19.650324,yuria,Magic,4,Back

81,Talisha,"Anyone who's been to the streets of Orvel has met this girl at least once. She passes on useful information to others at the Orvel Plaza, gives directions, and sometimes offers advice like a friend. She knows many people and is very experienced, but also sometimes gives others quite a shock by being friendly towards an unexpected person. Though she looks like a regular wanderer who enjoys traveling at first glance, she has a rather concrete goal; 'to see the most beautiful soul.' Ever since she was young, Talisha could see the lights of souls by using jewels. Clever Talisha soon realized that it was a special power only given to her, and she often enjoyed peeking into other people's souls. Later, she chose to be an information dealer because she could see more people, and meeting more people meant more lights of souls. As time passed, she became more and more skilled as an information dealer and soul appraiser. She learned that the best jewels to appraise souls were crystals imbued with mana. The more mana there was, the better she could see, and the more souls she appraised, the brighter the gem shone. She also learned that the colour of people's souls never stayed the same, and were constantly changing. Talisha, captivated by the beautiful colour and hues of the souls, wanted to appraise even more souls. She wanted to see the constantly changing brilliance of the souls and the momentary flash of glittering light with her very own eyes. In order to do that, she needed crystals that were imbued with lots of mana. Naturally, those kind of crystals were very rare and expensive. Talisha gave out information to gather crystals and people, and sometimes she herself would set out to find the source of some rumors. In the process, she once worked in a partnership with 'the owner of the Gold Bar', but due to a particular event, they became quite hostile towards each other, and ended up not even being able to stand hearing the other' name. Of course, to Talisha, that was just one of the 'small things' that happened during her journey. Talisha met Dosarta, who waits for the day when she can finally leave the Tower of Challenge, Turan, who Talisha considers a sister, a noble lady who she briefly met in Penteonia, Evan, the kind alchemist, and the energetic Commander Taily... Talisha saw the colour of all their souls and committed every one of them to memory. Even the soul of the Gold Bar's owner, whom she didn't even want to think about. Talisha was content with her life, and firmly believed she would be happy if she could continue to travel and see souls. But one day, she came across a particular gossip. It was a rumor that The Crystal of Blue Water, which had never been seen before and was treated as an old legend, had finally appeared. In Talisha's content life, a single question started to form. What would she be able to see if she looked at a soul with that crystal? If she saw the world's most beautiful soul with it, how brilliantly would those colours shine? Talisha made a decision. She promised herself that she would get her hands on that crystal by any means, and see the most brilliant flash of light.",2020-07-07 0:00:00,2020-07-07 0:00:00,talisha,Magic,4,Back
82,Evan,"The Gretchen family is a high-ranking vampire family that is called as the guardian of wisdom and the pursuer of knowledge. They have poured their efforts into the study and knowledge of magic for centuries. While they were the distant relatives of the princess Lewisia, they always have upheld the rule of not interfering with the humans, as they believed humans were fools who were swayed by greed. But when the current head of the family, Vilhelmina La Gretchen, married a human, their immense knowledge that was concealed for centuries finally became accessible to humans. Barsi, the human who married Vilhelmina and took on her surname, was an alchemist of the Tower of Sage. He had been studying the beings of darkness which the vampires commanded and the darkness that had spread in the world. When he first heard rumors of the Gretchen family, he went to them and asked to become their student. After many incidents, Vilhelmina and Barsi soon became fast friends and came to love each other deeply. That is how Evan La Gretchen, one of the most brilliant minds among the Tower of Sage alchemists as well as the half-blood child of Vilhelmina and the human alchemist Barsi, was born. Unfortunately, Evan was weak from birth. Although he had inherited his mother's great darkness, his body was the same as a human, and therefore couldn't bear the dark power. He was always on the verge of death, and he couldn't even walk properly. In addition, since one of the properties of darkness was absorption, he was in constant danger of being devoured by his mother's power. After thinking about it for some time, Barsi took Evan and returned to the Tower of Sage, while Vilhelmina remained in her castle and continued to seek a way that her son could live more safely. Thankfully, Evan grew to be optimistic and positive, just like his father and showed interest in researching darkness. As he grew older, he tried to control the darkness within him. He acquired extensive knowledge of runes, alchemy, and elemental magic, becoming the greatest alchemist of the Tower of Sage at the age of 15. The only thing that he couldn't use was the magic that controls blood. Although the blood of a high-ranking vampire flowed through his veins, his body was too weak to hold up against the use of such magic. Despite this fact, he has achieved countless accomplishments, such as creating his own homunculus Naav Gehen as well as studying and observing the darkness that effects the world with Lewisia. To commend his talent and accomplishments, the Tower of Sage granted him the title of 'Green', meaning 'Researcher' - an honorable title given only to those who have attained incredible success with their research. While he still sometimes experiences slight pains and aches due to his inherently weak body when the power of darkness becomes stronger, nonetheless he has learned to survive without the help of his parents. Now, he is able to use his power of darkness freely and shows interest in the demonic energy of demons and the power of dragons as well. He also discovered a new type of darkness that is completely different from the currently existing darkness and named it 'Tidhar'. Until recently, Evan had been staying at the Tower of Sage, continuing his research on darkness, and keeping a close eye on the 'Eclipse phenomenon' discovered in the Aegina Desert. When he received a letter from Lewisia asking him for help on the darkness that appeared in the desert, he left for the sandy lands with Naav Gehen by his side.",2020-06-07 15:01:15.169405,2020-06-16 09:37:46.227723,evan,Physical,7,Middle

As the daughter of the guild master of a weapon guild, Hanus used to play with discarded firearms and blades when she was young. This is when the others discovered her ingenuity in arms. The Guild Alliance decided that they cannot allow such profound talent to go to waste. The Alliance, after barely managing to convince Hanus' father who fiercely disagreed with the Alliance's decision, recruited her. Hanus was trained along with other soldiers, and just as the Guild had expected, she displaced her talent on battlefield. Hanus' revolutionary weapons were ridiculously strong enough to shift the paradigm of warfare. Her craftmanship, combined with her masterful tactics, marked the birth of an ultimate soldier of the Allied Forces. Moreover, Hanus herself vastly enjoyed her life in the army, as she could utilize her handcrafted weapons to their fullest. However, great talent meant more demands and battles to fight. During an operation, Hanus ended up being wounded. Upon hearing this news about her daughter's injury, Hanus' father who detested seeing his daughter in the army ever since the early days, raised his voice against the Alliance, and strongly demanded her daughter to be discharged from service at once. However, as people say, no parents are strong enough to bend their child's will. Hanus, who would rather die than be discharged from service, persistently persuaded her father. In the end, she managed to get her father's approval, under the condition that she stays in the military only as an instructor that doesn't participate in battles. Currently, Hanus thinks that her life as an instructor is not too bad at all, but deep inside, she still yearns to return to battlefields.

Though they created various synthetic Demon Beasts, Golems, and even humans, every one of their subjects failed to retain their form and ended up falling to pieces. The scientists of the research facility turned their attention to the powerful beings called 'Transcendants,' who were already close to the source. With the data of the Transcendants gathered by the kingdom, the scientists created Hilda, an artifical Transcendant.
Hilda was simply a tool to create a new world; her purpose was to escapoe the cycle and destroy the current rules.
